#SassCast, the interview
The basic format behind SassCast is an open mic allowing the interviewee to share their experiences. Who they are, interesting anecdotal experiences, career moves and of course how Sass has or is currently playing a role in their projects. 

##Questions
SassCast guests will be given a few starter questions that they will have the opportunity to read ahead of time in order to get a feel for the scope of the PodCast. These questions are not a script, but basically designed to 'break the ice' for the show and intended to hightlight the guests experiences with Sass.

##PodCast format
Each show will follow a basic format for pace and consistency. Average PodCast is expected to last up to 30min. If the interview is going well, going up to an hour is not discouraged.

## Hardware/software
SassCast interviewes are conducted online via Skype. A guest is required to have a Skype account for the interview. It is recomended that the guest use a headset mic to reduce noise. If a headset mic is not available, SassCast requests that the interviewee be in a quiet room when speaking into their computer mic.

##Time cues and post interview editing
Rarely will these interviewees be posted 'as is'. Dead air, the occasional 'uncomfortable moment' and those pesky flubs and gaffes will be edited out. At any time if the guest feels that they trailed off and said something that they feel unconfortable about, please alert the host. 

Throughout the interview, the host will provide time warnings and, use statements like: "one more question", or "let's wrap this up, can you quickly tell me" to cue your guest that the interview is coming to an end. 

##Just have fun
These interviews are not only designed to educate but to entertain an audience. Be yourself, relax and be passionate about what you are talking about. After all, we are talking about Sass, an emerging language that is taking the world by storm. What's NOT to be passionate about?
